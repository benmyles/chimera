* http://wiki.github.com/benmyles/chimera/

== DESCRIPTION:

Chimera is an object mapper for Ruby that uses both Redis and Riak. Redis is an extremely fast key-value store with support for several data types including lists and sets that make it ideal for storing meta-data such as indexes and associations. Riak is a decentralized document store with automatic horizontal scaling based on Amazonâ€™s Dynamo and is ideal for storing huge amounts of data across many machines. Chimera combines Redis and Riak to give you the best of both worlds.
